# ArithmaticComplexCalculator

This project can solve complex mathematical problems on- 
- 1) measures of Central tendency :(`arithmatic mean`)
- 2) measures of Dispersion :(`mean deviation`, `standard deviation`)
- 3) curve fitting and method of least Squares :( `Fitting Straight Line`
 and `Parabola`,` fitting exponential curve` and `geometric curves`) 
- 4) correlation and regression(`Correlation coefficient` ,`Rank` etc).
